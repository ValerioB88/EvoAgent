# About Me 
I am Valerio Biscione, a scientist currently working with the [Mind and Machine lab][1] at Bristol University, UK. I am interested in Psychology, Machine Learning, Evolution, Vision, and Music. I am an occasional [pianist and composer][5]. I am based in [Salerno][6], Italy. \
My more general website (but still badly updated) is [this one][2]. \
Here I'll write uniquely about EvoAgent, the ideas I want to try with it, and the development process. \
EvoAgent stems directly from [EvoRobot][3], a software developed (but, AFAIK, not mantained since years) at CNR in Rome, where I worked for a bit in the past with the late [Domenico Parisi][4], and that was part of my BSc Thesis. I had tremendous fun doing socio-anthropological simulations over there, and always thought about building a more modern EvoRobot, using current evolutionary algorithms and going back doing some cool evolutionary experiments. My interest in evolutionary game theory and evolutionary analysis has only growth with time, hence this project. 
I am working on this during my free time, after work, and I have a baby on the way, so progress is not going to be a lightspeed pace, quite the opposite. 
If you want to contribute you are free to do so, but I don't have a process in place for doing that. I guess start by opening an Issue and we'll take it from there.

Finally, this project is dedicated to the loving memory of Domenico Parisi.
